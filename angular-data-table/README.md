## **Design Decisions**
- **Reusable Component**: The `DataTableComponent` is designed to be reusable and can be easily extended for additional features.
- **Error Handling**: Errors are caught and displayed gracefully, ensuring a good user experience.

- **Responsive Design**: The table is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

---

## **Packages**
- **Angular**: Core framework for building the application.
- **Font Awesome**: For icons (search, sorting arrows).
